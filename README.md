# Game_of_Thrones_network_analysis

The project aims to analyze the co-occurrence networks formed in each novel from the series of Game of Thrones (Song of Ice and Fire). A co-occurrence network is when, two characters in the novel are mentioned within 15 words of each other, thus a link is formed between them. Using the networks from book 1 to book 5 of the series, the following tasks were performed for each book's network:-

* Basic network characteristics
* Character importance and evolution
* Community detection
* Link prediction
